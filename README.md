Hello!

I'm Maria Jose, Frontend Developer. I have made a bootcamp in Adalab where I have developed different languages: HTML5, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and React.

Nowadays, I keep on studying and developing in this field with Geekshub Academy, expanding my knowledge of Frontend such as: NodeJS, Webpack and Redux. 
In addition to strengthen all the knowledge acquired previously. 

I am actively looking for a job.
You can visit my Linkedin to know more about me  ðŸ˜„.
